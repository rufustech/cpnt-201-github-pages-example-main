## Introduction

This is a simple, interactive memory game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The player needs to match pairs of icons by flipping cards. It’s designed to be a fun and engaging way to enhance memory and concentration skills.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Smooth animations for a better user experience.
- **Score Tracking**: Scores are updated based on successful matches.
- **Initial Card Display**: Cards are shown for 5 seconds before starting the game.
- **Responsive Design**: Adaptable layout for various screen sizes.
- **Visual Feedback**: Highlights matched and unmatched pairs.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <https://github.com/your-username/memory-game-app.git>

2. Navigate to the project directory:

  ```bash
    cd memory-game-app
  ```

3. Open the index.html file in your preferred browser to start the game.

## How to Play

1. At the start of the game, all cards are visible for 5 seconds to help you memorize their positions.
2. After 5 seconds, the cards will flip over and become hidden.

3. Click on a card to reveal its icon and try to find its matching pair.
4. If two flipped cards match, they will remain visible, and you score 5 points.
5. If the cards do not match, they will flip back over after a short delay.
6. The game ends when all pairs are matched, and your score will be displayed.
